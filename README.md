# Wallaby React Native (not CRNA)

The application has been specifically built to be included as a showcase for [Wallabyjs #1583](https://github.com/wallabyjs/public/issues/1583).

It seems to be working with normal `ts` files (e.g. see `utils` folder) but it doesn't work with normal components (`components` folder).
